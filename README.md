Sendify : An XMPP based Notification System

Sendify is a new, self-contained product intended for use on the ‘Web’ as well as the ‘Android’ platforms.

Its JS library and Android SDK APIs enable developers to create real time XMPP powered web and mobile application in few hours.

The  system  has  two  types  of  clients  -  publishers  and  subscribers  -  also  referred  to  as 
producers  and  consumers  respectively.  Publishers  communicate  asynchronously  with 
subscribers by producing and sending a message to a topic, which is a logical access point 
and  communication  channel.  Subscribers  (that  is,  web  servers,  email  addresses,  et  al.) 
consume or receive the message or notification over one of the supported protocols (that is, 
HTTP/S, XMPP, et al.) when they are subscribed to the topic.
